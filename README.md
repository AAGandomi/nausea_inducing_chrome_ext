# Nausea-inducing generosity project

## Abstract
Winter celebrations are generally regarded as the period of the year when people in the northern hemisphere embrace the holiday spirit of giving and sharing with others.

Although such spirit has brought joy and merriment in the world and societies at large, various individuals have reported nauseous sensations, allegedly caused by an excessive display of generosity.

At ~~Satan~~Santa's R&D North Pole Software division (Korvatunturi, FI), fellow joyful engineers have attempted to replicate these reported sensations to study the phenomenon.

This repository contains the code of a Google Chrome extension that enhances the user's web browsing with an analogous experience.
